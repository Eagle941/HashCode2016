public class Planner {
    //0. Parse and instantiate
    //1. Divide map into voronoi regions
    //2. Sort areas by number of orders that need to be delivered there
    //3. Send drones to warehouse in order (one to each or as many as necessary?)
    //4. Each drone will load as many products as it can for houses that are close by each other
    // (but we prefer a single drone to fill out one order)
    //5. Deliver to the house in order of distance from warehouse
    //6. Go to next closest warehouse with the most orders to be fulfilled in that area
